            <p>Jeff is the consummate professional. He has the unique ability to listen and understand what a specific set of objectives and business needs are, concisely organize these thoughts, apply them to his in depth technical understanding, and produce a comprehensive solution that he then presents in understandable terms to his audience. This is a very impressive skill, to say the least, when dealing with a diverse group of business and technical disciplines. His personality is a well rounded addition to any group and his contributions can be concise and to the point or illustrative in times that require it.
