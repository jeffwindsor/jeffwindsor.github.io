    <h3><em>James Lively, Director Enterprise Software and Development at Idaho National Laboratory</em></h3>
    <p>Jeff is the consummate professional. He has the unique ability to listen and understand what a specific set of objectives and business needs are, concisely organize these thoughts, apply them to his in depth technical understanding, and produce a comprehensive solution that he then presents in understandable terms to his audience. This is a very impressive skill, to say the least, when dealing with a diverse group of business and technical disciplines. His personality is a well rounded addition to any group and his contributions can be concise and to the point or illustrative in times that require it. I would gladly work with Jeff again on future strategic projects.</p>

    <p>To say that Jeff Windsor is talented is a tremendous understatement. We worked together early in our careers at Lyondell and I was very fortunate to have found myself associated with a person of his professional character at that time. Without exaggeration, his intellect is amongst the most elite I have ever encountered. Jeff’s ability to grasp new technology and incorporate it into a business enterprise is extraordinary. Working with Jeff was a great experience, counting him as a friend is a true honor.</p>
