                <blockquote>Jeff is the consummate professional. He has the unique ability to listen
                    and understand what a specific set of objectives and business needs are,
                    concisely organize these thoughts, apply them to his in depth technical
                    understanding, and produce a comprehensive solution that he then presents
                    in understandable terms to his audience. This is a very impressive skill,
                    to say the least, when dealing with a diverse group of business and technical
                    disciplines. His personality is a well rounded addition to any group and
                    his contributions can be concise and to the point or illustrative in times
                    that require it. I would gladly work with Jeff again on future strategic
                    projects.

                    it into a business enterprise is extraordinary. Working with Jeff was a
                    great experience, counting him as a friend is a true honor.
