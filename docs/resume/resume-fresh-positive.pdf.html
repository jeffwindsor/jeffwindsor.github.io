          <p>Jeff is the consummate professional. He has the unique ability to listen and understand what a specific set of objectives and business needs are, concisely organize these thoughts, apply them to his in depth technical understanding, and produce a comprehensive solution that he then presents in understandable terms to his audience. This is a very impressive skill, to say the least, when dealing with a diverse group of business and technical disciplines. His personality is a well rounded addition to any group and his contributions can be concise and to the point or illustrative in times that require it. I would gladly work with Jeff again on future strategic projects.</p>

          <p>I had the pleasure of working with Jeff for about a year. He bridges the worlds of technology and business as well as any one with whom I&#39;ve ever worked. Jeff has a keen mind for building technology, working with a team and contributing to the vision of a company. I hope that one day we work together again.</p>

          <p>To say that Jeff Windsor is talented is a tremendous understatement. We worked together early in our careers at Lyondell and I was very fortunate to have found myself associated with a person of his professional character at that time. Without exaggeration, his intellect is amongst the most elite I have ever encountered. Jeff’s ability to grasp new technology and incorporate it into a business enterprise is extraordinary. Working with Jeff was a great experience, counting him as a friend is a true honor.</p>

          <p>Jeff is one of the most talented individuals with whom I&#39;ve had the honor to work and learn. He was crucial to getting several applications and processes in place, and personally took the time to give me direction and information when I needed it. He is an exceptional and dedicated person, a rare kind of developer and professional.</p>
