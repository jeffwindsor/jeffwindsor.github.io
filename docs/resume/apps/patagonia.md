## Why do you want to work for Patagonia?

Through my family and the Scouts, I gained a deep respect for our wilderness, oceans and our great open spaces.  I want those spaces to endure and my three boys to have the chance to experience them as I did.  Patagonia's mission speaks to me and to that desire.
It is my goal to work locally in Ventura, reducing my daily impact on the planet by trading 60 mile car commutes with bike commutes.  I greatly appreciate the simplicity and minimal ethos Patagonia has, since it is the path I am following.

## What should we know about you that might not be on your resume?

I am an Eagle Scout. I have traveled and explored every Continent (except Antartica, although I did get close twice).  I moved to Ventura, last year with our three boys and my wife who is a doctor at CMH (both Ventura and Ojia)
